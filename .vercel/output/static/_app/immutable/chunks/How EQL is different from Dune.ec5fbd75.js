The ultimate objective of the project is to create a fully decentralized storage engine, enabling anyone to query EVM chains using a relational approach similar to SQL databases.

Dune users write SQL queries to access data from various raw Ethereum tables, combining different datasets to obtain the desired insights.

In terms of storage, the platform uses a fork of Trino as its query engine, which supports Ethereum types natively, such as addresses and transaction hashes. Trino is a query engine where the execution layer is decoupled from the storage layer. Unlike traditional SQL databases, where query execution and storage are built into a monolithic system, Trino is well-suited for distributing both processing and storage across a cluster of servers. As a result, scaling the number of nodes also increases the amount of data the platform can process in parallel. The Trino syntax is similar to regular the regular SQL syntax used by most of the relational databases such as MySql and Postgres.",mt,M,hs=`Although EQL’s long-term goal is to develop its own storage engine to efficiently distribute Ethereum data across the network and enable efficient P2P relational queries, the project currently relies on JSON-RPC providers as the “storage engine.” The downside is that EQL cannot process large numbers of blocks in a single request due to the rate limits imposed by public RPC providers, which on an average, using public RPCs, queries can process ~200 blocks, accounts, and transactions in a single query. However, there is a workaround for this limitation in development.
EQL provides a SQL-like syntax that leverages the predictable relationships between key Ethereum entities—blocks, accounts, transactions, and logs—to create a more direct way of querying on-chain data. One example of how this syntax can be more efficient compared to SQL syntax—which is designed to handle all types of table relationships—is a simple query to fetch account information.
