  return `<h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1vuejea">How is EQL different from Dune?</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-sxs8o8">The title of this article captures the initial reaction many people have when they first learn about EVM Query Language (EQL). Although there are surface-level similarities between EQL and Dune, these two projects are fundamentally distinct in their goals, design, and use cases.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n6yhee">EQL and Dune serve distinct purposes: while Dune excels at data visualization and cross-chain querying, EQL is optimized for efficiently querying EVM chains using a simplified SQL-like syntax. EQL’s syntax is designed to be intuitive, making it easier for SQL users to adapt to, especially those familiar with querying blockchain data. While Dune provides more comprehensive data handling capabilities for larger datasets and complex queries, EQL outperforms Dune in tasks such as transaction lookups by hash and account state retrievals, particularly when working with smaller, more focused datasets. However, for large-scale queries involving multiple blocks or datasets, Dune’s robust infrastructure and caching mechanisms give it a performance edge.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-15fvks2">Outlining the projects</h2> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-wpzdqy">Dune</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xkpa8p">Dune is a data analytics platform designed for querying and visualizing blockchain data, primarily focused on Ethereum and other related blockchains. It provides users with the ability to run SQL queries on publicly available on-chain data, making it possible to extract, analyze, and visualize information from these blockchains. Users interact with the data primarily through a SQL-based query engine that supports custom and predefined queries, enhanced by caching and parallel processing for performance. The platform offers interactive dashboards for visualization, supporting various chart types and dynamic filtering, and facilitates collaboration through public sharing and forking of dashboards.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-16k078s">EQL</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-f147jx">EQL is a data extraction tool that offers users a SQL-like language to execute queries and retrieve data from EVM chains. The syntax is currently under active development to simplify access to on-chain data for researchers and developers.
The ultimate objective of the project is to create a fully decentralized storage engine, enabling anyone to query EVM chains using a relational approach similar to SQL databases. Unlike Dune, EQL does not aim to index or decode various smart contracts and on-chain data.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-4r51qf">How are the projects similar?</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kwxeh6">While EQL and Dune differ significantly in their design and long-term objectives, they do share several common features, particularly in their ability to extract and export blockchain data. Both platforms allow users to run queries that extract on-chain information, though the exact methods and formats differ.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12czg85">In terms of data extraction, both Dune and EQL enable users to retrieve information from blockchain ecosystems using SQL-like query languages. Dune users write SQL queries to access data from various raw Ethereum tables, combining different datasets to obtain the desired insights. EQL, by contrast, offers a specialized SQL-like syntax tailored specifically to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), streamlining access to crucial blockchain data such as accounts, transactions, and balances. This specialization allows for more direct and efficient querying of on-chain data.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-16wnxr4">Both platforms also provide options for exporting query results, though they differ in terms of formats and pricing. Dune allows users to export query results directly through its interface, but this is limited to CSV format and only available with a paid plan. Free users must export data via API requests, which requires some additional technical steps. On the other hand, EQL, being open-source, offers greater flexibility and no cost barriers. Users can export data in a variety of formats, including JSON, CSV, and Parquet, without any restrictions, making it a more flexible and accessible option for developers and researchers.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3ivuj3">In summary, while Dune and EQL differ in their broader goals and the scope of their query languages, they share important functionalities in data extraction and export capabilities. Dune excels in user-friendly visualization and cross-chain functionality, while EQL stands out for its flexible query syntax and free access to multiple export formats, appealing to users with a more technical or development-oriented focus.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1mcer2f">How are the projects different?</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1a6vlkp">As mentioned above, Dune is a platform focused on efficient querying and data visualization. In terms of storage, the platform uses a fork of Trino as its query engine, which supports Ethereum types natively, such as addresses and transaction hashes. Trino is a query engine where the execution layer is decoupled from the storage layer. Unlike traditional SQL databases, where query execution and storage are built into a monolithic system, Trino is well-suited for distributing both processing and storage across a cluster of servers. As a result, scaling the number of nodes also increases the amount of data the platform can process in parallel. The Trino syntax is similar to regular the regular SQL syntax used by most of the relational databases such as MySql and Postgres.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bxu6gd">Although EQL’s long-term goal is to develop its own storage engine to efficiently distribute Ethereum data across the network and enable efficient P2P relational queries, the project currently relies on JSON-RPC providers as the “storage engine.” The downside is that EQL cannot process large numbers of blocks in a single request due to the rate limits imposed by public RPC providers, which on an average, using public RPCs, queries can process ~200 blocks, accounts, and transactions in a single query. However, there is a workaround for this limitation in development.
EQL provides a SQL-like syntax that leverages the predictable relationships between key Ethereum entities—blocks, accounts, transactions, and logs—to create a more direct way of querying on-chain data. One example of how this syntax can be more efficient compared to SQL syntax—which is designed to handle all types of table relationships—is a simple query to fetch account information. For instance, let’s examine how to retrieve the nonce and address of Vitalik’s account using Dune and Trino’s SQL syntax:</p> <pre class="language-sql"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->${`<code class="language-sql"><span class="token keyword">WITH</span> account_balance <span class="token keyword">as</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>

Dune is a comprehensive platform that emphasizes data visualization and user collaboration, making it an ideal tool for analysts and researchers looking to query and visualize data from multiple blockchains, not limited to the Ethereum ecosystem. Its use of Trino as a query engine, along with interactive dashboards, allows users to handle complex queries and create rich visual reports. EQL, on the other hand, is specialized on querying EVM blockchains with a simplified, domain-specific syntax. It is designed to be lightweight, free, and open-source, with a goal of decentralizing data access. Unlike Dune, which focuses on visualizations and user interfaces, EQL operates more like a language/REPL, specializing in efficient blockchain data extraction and flexible data exports. EQL is designed for querying Ethereum-based data in a direct way but lacks the broader ecosystem of tools and integrations that Dune offers. As the EQL ecosystem grows, there is an opportunity for developers to contribute by building tools and interfaces that enhance its functionality and usability.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-k9lln9">When should you use EQL over Dune</h2> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1a3bfgw"><li>Quick exploration of data</li> <li>Quickly check Ethereum state</li> <li>Check data about one or many accounts</li> <li>Query different objects that can’t be cached</li></ul> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1gxw3xi">Benchmarks</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bxjj5y">Dune offers an extensive range of datasets for users to build and customize their queries, allowing flexible data cross-referencing. However, for the purpose of these benchmarks, we are specifically focusing on the common elements between EQL and Dune, which include core Ethereum components such as blocks, transactions, accounts, and logs (traces <em>soon™</em>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1v194or">In this section, we’ll compare the types of queries that both Dune and EQL enable.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1g1bzmh">Test Environment</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vbxd30">The tests were performed on a system with the following specifications:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1sfggo7"><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Ryzen 9 5900x</li> <li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB HyperX Fury (Dual Channel)</li> <li><strong>Storage</strong>: 1TB Kingston NV2 M.2 2280 SSD</li> <li><strong>Internet Connection</strong>: 300 Mbps</li></ul> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-x9f8y3">Testing Methodology</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-jz3e3j">For each platform, ten query executions were collected to gather performance metrics. While executing a larger number of queries, such as one hundred, would provide more comprehensive data, the manual method employed to collect Dune metrics made expanding the number of records impractical and unproductive. Although Dune offers an API for fetching data from endpoints, it only returns data from the most recent execution of a specified query. This behavior effectively caches the last result, undermining the ability to perform a meaningful comparison between the performance of EQL and Dune.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6nf2iy">Consequently, Dune queries were executed directly through the application’s web user interface without any caching mechanisms or materialization configurations. The metrics were gathered solely based on the data provided by the app. In contrast, EQL metrics were collected using the <code>eql_core</code> Rust crate. The <code>eql</code> function within this crate was utilized to execute queries by passing them as parameters and retrieving the results. To ensure accurate and reliable performance measurements, the Criterion benchmarking library was employed to collect and analyze the metrics.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1tmzh16">Dune offers three query engine options: Free, Medium, and Large. The Free engine is the slowest but has no cost. The Medium engine costs 10 credits per query, with a monthly limit of 2,500 credits. The Large engine, which requires a subscription, provides 25,000 monthly credits. It costs 20 credits per query and is priced at $349 per month, billed annually. The tests collected data separately from both the Free and Medium plans, as these plans are offered at no cost. This allows for a fair comparison, since EQL is also a free option for querying on-chain data.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1crki26">Testing Conditions and Considerations</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-86rcou">These tests were conducted as of 2024-09-21. It is essential to acknowledge that Dune’s performance may vary during peak usage times, similar to other web applications. Such fluctuations could affect the consistency of the results. If any of the outcomes appear to deviate significantly from the expected average performance, it is recommended to rerun the tests to verify their accuracy and ensure the reliability of the comparative analysis.
EQL’s performance is influenced by several factors, including processing power, network conditions, and the efficiency of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Ensuring optimal conditions in these areas is crucial for achieving the best possible performance outcomes with EQL.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-8gvi54">The tests</h3> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1jmpvwm"><li><strong>Account State Fetch</strong>: Nonce and Balance</li> <li><strong>Transaction Lookup by Hash</strong>: 100 Transactions</li> <li><strong>Event Log Fetch</strong>: USDC Transfers in 100 Block Range</li> <li><strong>Block Range Fetch</strong>: 100 Blocks</li> <li><strong>Sequential Block Fetch</strong>: 100 Blocks Individually</li></ul> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-za8bz7"><strong>Account State Fetch</strong>: Nonce and Balance</h4> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1wj143q">Queries:</p> <pre class="language-sql"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->${`<code class="language-sql"><span class="token comment"># Dune</span>

It also shows more reliable execution times with lower variability, making it a better choice for users requiring predictability.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8c938b">Dune Free excels in block range fetches, particularly when scanning 100 blocks. Its infrastructure seems optimized for this type of query, making it more efficient than both EQL and Dune Medium. Despite being a free tier, it consistently outperforms the paid Dune Medium option in this area.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8qfvqi">Dune Medium, despite being a larger query engine, shows high variability and does not offer better performance than Dune Free in block range queries. Its inconsistency across event log fetches and account state queries limits its reliability.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ujct2y">The unexpected performance gap between Dune Free and Dune Medium in block fetches remains unexplained.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1drnudk">Final thoughts</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hn76mx">EQL and Dune both allow users to query blockchain data, but they serve different needs. EQL uses a simple, SQL-like syntax tailored for EVM chains, making it easy for developers to query Ethereum data quickly. It’s ideal for exploring Ethereum state, checking accounts, and querying objects that can’t be cached. EQL outperforms Dune in tasks like transaction lookups and account state queries, offering faster execution and free access to multiple export formats.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ln6bs3">Dune, by contrast, is better for processing large datasets and handling complex queries across multiple blockchains. It offers advanced data visualization, interactive dashboards, and collaboration features, making it ideal for analysts and researchers. Dune uses traditional SQL and Trino, allowing for familiar query operations.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ufwfsr">Currently, EQL has limits with handling large datasets due to its reliance on JSON-RPC providers, but improvements are underway. Benchmark tests show EQL excels at specific tasks like transaction lookups, while Dune is faster in block range queries thanks to its infrastructure and caching.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1asmdzn">Use EQL for quick, efficient EVM blockchain queries, or choose Dune for robust data processing, visualization, and cross-chain functionality. Both platforms have unique strengths, so the right choice depends on your specific use case.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ct0k27">If you’re interested in exploring EQL further, you can try it out through our <a href="https://eql.sh" rel="nofollow">web-REPL</a>, check out the <a href="https://github.com/iankressin/eql" rel="nofollow">GitHub repo</a> for ongoing updates, or join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1247647880634695730/1267420527765622878" rel="nofollow">Discord</a> to connect with others and share ideas.</p>`;
